# Warp Plus

1.1.1.1 is a decent alternative. No data cap. Decent speed. But the problem is you can't choose which server you want use. It'll auto select the server based on your location. You can generate premium account for free which will give you additional benefits.

!!!light 1.1.1.1 vs WARP vs WARP+
- 1.1.1.1 provides encrypted DNS.
- WARP provides encrypted DNS, and an encrypted tunnel for all network traffic between your device and the [Cloudflare servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) **nearest to you**.
- WARP+ provides encrypted DNS, and an encrypted tunnel for all network traffic between your device and the Cloudflare servers closest to the website you're accessing. The encrypted traffic is sent through Cloudflare's global private network in a route optimized by Cloudflare's [Argo Smart Routing technology](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/).
