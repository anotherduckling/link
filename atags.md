# Audio Quality Tags

## AAC 2.0
AAC 2.0, or Advanced Audio Coding 2.0, is a type of audio codec that is designed to compress audio files with minimal loss of quality. It is commonly used for streaming and online music services, and it is supported by most media players and devices.

## AC3
AC3, or Dolby Digital, is an audio codec that is commonly used for DVD and Blu-ray movies. It uses a technique called perceptual coding to compress audio files, and it can provide surround sound with up to 5.1 channels.

## DD Audio Format
DD 5.1 and DD 7.1 are audio formats that refer to the number of channels in the audio.

### DD 5.1
DD 5.1 stands for Dolby Digital 5.1, which is a surround sound format that uses six channels: five full bandwidth channels (left, center, right, left surround, and right surround) and one low-frequency effects channel (the ".1" in 5.1).

### DD 7.1
DD 7.1, also known as Dolby Digital Plus 7.1, is an advanced version of DD 5.1, which includes an additional two channels for a total of eight channels (left, center, right, left surround, right surround, left surround back and right surround back, and a low-frequency effects channel). It is commonly used in home theater systems and other high-fidelity audio systems.

## DDP Audio Format
DDP 2.0, DDP 5.1, and DDP 7.1 are all variations of the DTS audio codec. They are used in the context of digital audio releases, such as in the case of music albums.

### DDP 2.0
DDP 2.0, or DTS Digital Surround 2.0, provides 2 channels of audio, which is the same as a stereo audio track.

### DDP 5.1
DDP 5.1, or DTS Digital Surround 5.1, provides 5.1 channels of surround sound, which includes a left channel, a right channel, a center channel, and two surround channels. This allows for a more immersive and realistic surround sound experience, with sounds coming from more directions and with more separation.

### DDP 7.1
DDP 7.1, or DTS Digital Surround 7.1, provides 7.1 channels of surround sound, which includes a left channel, a right channel, a center channel, two surround channels, two rear surround channels, and a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel. This allows for an even more immersive and realistic surround sound experience, with sounds coming from even more directions and with even more separation.

## DTS Audio Format
DTS, or Digital Theater Systems, is a surround sound format that uses a technique called subband coding to compress audio files. It was developed by Digital Theater Systems, Inc. (DTS) and it's used in a variety of applications such as movies, television shows, video games, and music. DTS uses a lossy compression algorithm, which means that some of the original audio data is lost during compression, but it can still provide a high-quality audio experience. DTS supports up to 7.1 channels of surround sound and it's widely supported by most home theater systems, A/V receivers, and media players.

DTS audio codecs are also used in other audio formats such as DTS-HD Master Audio, DTS-X and DDP 5.1.

### DTS-HDMA
DTS-HD Master Audio is a lossless surround sound format that provides high-quality audio with up to 7.1 channels of surround sound. It's an extension of the standard DTS format and it's designed for high-definition video content.

### DTS:X
DTS:X is an object-based surround sound format that was developed by DTS. It also supports up to 128 audio tracks and up to 64 speakers, including overhead speakers. It can also be delivered in various channel.

## Dolby TrueHD
TrueHD is a lossless multi-channel audio codec developed by Dolby Laboratories. It is an advanced version of the popular Dolby Digital (AC3) codec, and it is designed to provide high-quality, lossless audio that is virtually identical to the original studio master recording.

TrueHD audio is typically found on Blu-ray Discs and streaming services, and it is capable of delivering up to 8 channels of surround sound at a sample rate of up to 192 kHz and 24-bit resolution. This means it can deliver high-quality audio with a wide frequency range and dynamic range, and it can accurately reproduce subtle details and nuances in the audio.

TrueHD is considered as a high-quality audio codec and it is an alternative to DTS-HD Master Audio codec which is also used in Blu-ray Discs and streaming services.

Keep in mind that TrueHD audio requires a compatible player and audio system to decode and play the audio. Some devices and systems may not support TrueHD, so it is important to check the specifications of your equipment before purchasing a movie or TV show with TrueHD audio.

!!!light Summary
Dolby TrueHD is a lossless multi-channel audio codec that provides high-quality, lossless audio that is virtually identical to the original studio master recording. It is commonly found on Blu-ray Discs and streaming services as an alternative to DTS-HD Master Audio codec. In order to fully experience the Dolby TrueHD audio quality, a compatible player and audio system is required to decode and play the audio.
