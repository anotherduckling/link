!!!danger Don't use MTL
Using Machine Translation to translate manga can be a bit of a mess. Manga has lots of slang, cultural references, and visual elements that MT might not understand. So, it's better to have a human translator who knows the language and culture well. You don't want to end up with a wonky or inaccurate translation!
